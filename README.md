# inchworm

This game is so much more than an indie side-scrolling platformer. It's zen, an adventure, a way of life. As such, anybody who is capable can play Inchworm --- even you!

Inchworm is designed with minimalism and compatibility in mind. You can play it in your web browser without having to download or install any more programs. Hopefully, it will run on your operating system of choice, even if that isn't one of the mainstream choices.

Developers are welcome to join the Inchworm programming team. You can comment in the IRC chat room. You can fork, bend, or harness Inchworm any way that you like. You can spin up your own Inchworm server if that is what you want to do. With Inchworm, rules are made to be broken. The world is your oyster!

Beware: nature is an unforgiving beast! It's a dog-eat-dog world out there, and if you don't succeed... somebody else will! Do you have what it takes to climb trees, eat leaves, and trapeze your way to victory on a gossamer thread? There's only one way to find out!
